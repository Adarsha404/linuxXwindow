# Listener and Backdoor
This repository contains two Python scripts: a listener and a backdoor, which allow communication between a host and a victim machine over a network. The listener runs on Kali Linux and listens for commands from the backdoor running on a Windows machine.

# Listener Code

The `listener.py` script sets up a listener on Kali Linux to receive commands from the backdoor. It provides a command-line interface to interact with the backdoor and perform various actions such as executing commands, downloading files, and uploading files to the victim machine.

To use the listener:
1. Run the `listener.py` script on Kali Linux.
2. Enter commands in the format: `<command> <arguments>`. For example, `download file.txt`.

## Backdoor Code

The `backdoor.py` script is designed to be run on a Windows machine and establishes a connection with the listener. It waits for commands from the listener, executes them, and sends the results back.

To use the backdoor:
1. Run the `backdoor.py` script on a Windows machine.
2. The backdoor will attempt to connect to the listener.
3. Once connected, you can enter commands in the listener to interact with the backdoor.

### Important Notes
- The scripts use JSON serialization for command and result communication that's why there are so many encoding and decoding performed.
- Customize the scripts as needed for your use case.
